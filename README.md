Step 5: Text Editors and IDE

You probably don't need two different IDEs...but you might enjoy taking Atom and Visual Studio Code for a side-by-side test run, so we've included installation instructions for each.

If you have a preference, certainly take your pick!

    If you are participating in a DevNet Express Cloud Collaboration IT Pros, we recommend using VS Code

Atom
Installation

    Navigate to atom.io

    The site should detect your OS and offer you an appropriate download link

    Run the downloaded installer taking the defaults

Verification

    Once installation finishes, Atom should open and display the interface

    Select "Yes, Always" to the question about registering the atom:// URI handler
